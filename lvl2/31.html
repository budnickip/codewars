    <p>Input will consist of a list of lists containing two items each. Each list contains information for a single potential member. Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.</p>
    <p>Note for F#: The input will be of (int list list) which is a List<List></p>
    <p>[[18, 20],[45, 2],[61, 12],[37, 6],[21, 21],[78, 9]]</p>
    <p>Output </p>
    <p>Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell: Open or Senior) stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.</p>
    <p>["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"]</p>
